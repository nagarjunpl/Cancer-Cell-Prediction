# 🧬 Cancer Cell Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of cancer cells plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates and improving treatment outcomes.

This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning techniques based on medical diagnostic data. The system analyzes cell features and provides accurate predictions to assist doctors and healthcare professionals in decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a machine learning model to predict cancer cells accurately
- Classify tumors as **Benign (Non-cancerous)** or **Malignant (Cancerous)**
- Reduce human error in early cancer diagnosis
- Demonstrate the application of machine learning in the healthcare domain

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual diagnosis of cancer based on biopsy reports can be time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a need for an automated, reliable, and fast system that can predict cancer cells using patient data and machine learning algorithms.
